class -----> class does not occupy memory, class contains data member,methods,nested class, constructor
Object ----> in java we can not execute any project without creating any creating any object, state--> attributes of an object,Behaviour----> methods of an object, it also helps in the response, Identity ---> unique name to the object 
Constructors----> constructors do not have even the void, the Primary purpose --> to set the intial values of instances varaiables or properties of the object being created, Another usage---> Allocating memory and establishing the connections to the external resources.
Types of Constructor -----> Parameterized Constructor----> custom intialization of each object, Default(no- argument or zero-argument) Constructor----> create default values like 0,null that and all, Copy constructor
Encapsulation -----> To achieve control over the data --> means here we can set other classes to access the present class, data hiding is achieved over here	
					----> Based on the encapsulation only we will declare the ---> variables as the private 
																				----> To access these private variables we will be using the Setter and getter.
Polymorphism ----> Polymorphism more than one form----> Types ----> 1. compile Time polynmorphism 2. Run Time polymorphism.
					Advantages -----> Code cleanliness, Overload constructors,Aligned with real world, Reusability and extensibility.
					Method overriding ----> compile time , method overloading ---> Run Time 
					Constructor overloading ----> 
Abstract -----> Example        public abstract class GraphicObject {
                                          						//declare fields
																// declare nonabstract
																method abstarct void ();
																draw();
								* Abstract class may or may not contain abstract methods
								* Abstract class should not be declared as final.
								* Abstract can not be directly intialized using the new keyword.
Interface -----> Blueprint of the class
                    ----> I t shall have both the static and the abstract methods.
						----> All the fields are public, static, and final by default.
